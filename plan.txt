FleetFlow
Modular Fleet & Logistics Management System
Full Project Implementation Document
Team Size:  4 Members
Duration:   5 Hours
Type:       Hackathon / Sprint Build
1. Project Overview
FleetFlow replaces inefficient manual logbooks with a centralized, rule-based digital hub that optimizes the lifecycle of a delivery fleet, monitors driver safety, and tracks financial performance. The system is built for four distinct user roles and covers eight core operational modules.
1.1 Objective
Build a working, demo-ready fleet management system in 5 hours with 4 team members, using real APIs, a live database, and a clean responsive UI that impresses judges through reliable core features rather than half-finished extras.
1.2 Target Users
User Role
Responsibilities
Fleet Manager
Oversee vehicle health, asset lifecycle, and overall scheduling
Dispatcher
Create trips, assign drivers, validate cargo loads before dispatch
Safety Officer
Monitor driver compliance, license expirations, and safety scores
Financial Analyst
Audit fuel spend, maintenance ROI, and total operational costs
1.3 Scope Decision — What We Build vs What We Cut
Given the 5-hour constraint, scope must be ruthlessly prioritized. Every feature below is categorized as either essential (must ship) or cut (dropped entirely to protect quality of core features).

4. Team Assignments & Responsibilities
Member
Role
Owns (Primary)
Priority Rule
Member A
Backend Lead
ALL Express APIs, DB migrations, seed data
Pure backend — no frontend work
Member B
Frontend Lead
React setup, Layout, Login, Dashboard, Analytics
Pure frontend — ask A for API contracts
Member C
Full-stack
Vehicle Registry (API + UI) THEN Trip Dispatcher (API + UI)
Finish Vehicle Registry 100% before touching Trip
Member D
Full-stack
Driver Profiles (API + UI) THEN Maintenance Logs (API + UI)
Finish Driver Profiles 100% before touching Maintenance
4.1 Git Branch Structure
main         ← final working version only (merge here at the very end)
dev          ← integration branch (everyone merges into this)
feat/apis-and-db       ← Member A
feat/frontend-core     ← Member B
feat/vehicles-trips    ← Member C
feat/drivers-maint     ← Member D
4.2 Git Commit Rules
Commit message format: feat: add cargo weight validation on POST /trips
Never commit directly to main or dev — always work on your feature branch
Merge into dev at: end of Hour 1, end of Hour 3, end of Hour 5
Pull from dev before starting each new hour to stay in sync
Member A handles all merge conflicts — they own the shared files
Rule: Every team member must have at least 6 individual commits by the end of the 5 hours. One member managing the repo is an instant disqualifier under the judging criteria.
5. API Reference (All Routes)
Member A builds all of these. Members B, C, and D treat this as a contract. Agree on the response shape by the end of Hour 1 so frontend devs can build against it.

6. Hour-by-Hour Execution Plan
CRITICAL: All team members must install Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Git BEFORE the 5 hours start. Member A creates the GitHub repo and shares access. Everyone clones and runs npm install the night before. If you skip this, you lose 45 minutes of build time.
Before Clock Starts — Pre-requisites
Member A: Create GitHub repo, add dev and main branches, share access to all members
Member A: Write .env.example file with DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_NAME, JWT_SECRET placeholders
Everyone: Clone repo, npm install on both client and server, confirm psql connection works
Everyone: Create a local PostgreSQL database named fleetflow_dev
Agree on API base URL (http://localhost:5000/api) and frontend port (5173)
⏱ Hour 1 (0:00 – 1:00) — Foundation
Goal: Everyone has a running server, a connected database with real seed data, and a React app with working routing by the end of this hour.
Member A — Backend
Init Express app with cors, helmet, express.json() middleware
Connect to PostgreSQL using pg or knex — confirm connection
Write and run all 5 table migrations (users, vehicles, drivers, trips, maintenance_logs)
Write and run seed script immediately — 5 vehicles, 5 drivers (1 with expired license), 8 trips, 3 maintenance logs
Build POST /api/auth/login — bcrypt compare, return JWT
Build GET /api/dashboard/stats — 4 KPI counts from DB
Member B — Frontend
Init React + Vite, install TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, React Router v6, Axios, React Query
Set up React Router with all 8 routes pointing to placeholder page components
Build sidebar navigation layout — this wraps every page component
Create Axios instance (lib/api.js) with base URL and JWT Authorization header auto-attached
Build Login page UI — email/password form, POST to auth API, store token in localStorage, redirect
Member C — Vehicle Registry
Build GET /api/vehicles and POST /api/vehicles API routes
Build PATCH /api/vehicles/:id for status and odometer updates
Build Vehicle Registry page — data table connected to real GET /api/vehicles
Add status pill component (color-coded: green=Available, blue=On Trip, red=In Shop, gray=Retired)
Member D — Driver Profiles
Build GET /api/drivers and POST /api/drivers API routes
Build PATCH /api/drivers/:id for duty status and safety score updates
Build Driver Profiles page — data table connected to real GET /api/drivers
Add license expiry red badge logic: if today > license_expiry show EXPIRED in red
End of Hour 1 Action: Everyone commits to their feature branch. Member A merges all branches into dev. Everyone pulls dev. This is the messiest merge — get it done early.
⏱ Hour 2 (1:00 – 2:00) — Core Features
Goal: All primary business logic is coded. Cargo validation works. Maintenance status flip works. Dashboard is live.
Member A
Build POST /api/trips — validate cargo_weight <= vehicle.max_capacity, return HTTP 400 with message if violated
Build PATCH /api/trips/:id/status — atomically update trip status + vehicle status + driver status in one transaction
Build POST /api/maintenance — in one DB transaction: insert log AND set vehicle.status = 'In Shop'
Build PATCH /api/maintenance/:id/close — set log.status = Closed AND vehicle.status = Available
Build GET /api/analytics/summary stub returning real data from DB
Member B
Build Dashboard page — 4 KPI cards (Active Fleet, Maintenance Alerts, Utilization Rate, Pending Cargo)
Implement auto-refresh: React Query refetchInterval: 8000 so data refreshes every 8 seconds
Add filter bar by vehicle type (Truck / Van / Bike) that filters the trip table on dashboard
Start Analytics page structure — placeholder charts ready for data in Hour 3
Member C
Add 'New Vehicle' modal with form validation — all fields required, license plate uniqueness check
Start Trip Dispatcher page — dropdown for vehicle selection showing only Available vehicles
Add driver dropdown showing only On Duty drivers with non-expired licenses
Add cargo weight input field with live yellow warning if approaching 90% of vehicle capacity
Member D
Add 'New Driver' registration modal with full field validation
Add duty status toggle button on each driver row (On Duty / Off Duty / Suspended)
Start Maintenance Logs page — log submission form connected to POST /api/maintenance
Verify that submitting a maintenance log immediately updates the vehicle status in the database
⏱ Hour 3 (2:00 – 3:00) — Complete All Modules
Goal: Every page is functional and connected to real data. All 7 modules are complete.
Member A
Build GET /api/drivers/expiring-soon — WHERE license_expiry <= NOW() + INTERVAL '30 days'
Build GET /api/reports/monthly — aggregate revenue, fuel cost, maintenance cost grouped by month
Add Joi input validation to all POST routes — return 400 with clear field-level error messages
Fix any API response inconsistencies discovered during Hour 2 frontend integration
Member B
Complete Analytics page — Recharts LineChart for fleet utilization over time
Add Recharts BarChart for vehicle status breakdown (Available / On Trip / In Shop counts)
Build Financial Summary table using data from GET /api/reports/monthly
Add CSV export button using xlsx library — exports monthly financial summary on click
Member C
Complete Trip Dispatcher — cargo weight validation blocks form submission if over limit
Add trips table showing all trips with status pills and action buttons (Dispatch / Complete / Cancel)
Wire status buttons to PATCH /api/trips/:id/status — verify vehicle and driver status updates
Test: create a trip, dispatch it, complete it, verify statuses flip correctly throughout
Member D
Complete Maintenance Logs page — table of all logs with vehicle name, cost, date, open/closed status
Add close maintenance button — calls PATCH /api/maintenance/:id/close, vehicle returns to Available
Add driver safety score display — percentage badge with color coding (green >80%, amber >60%, red <60%)
Add trip completion rate display on each driver row
End of Hour 3 Action: Commit everything. Member A merges all into dev. Everyone pulls. This is the second major sync point.
⏱ Hour 4 (3:00 – 4:00) — Integration Testing (DO NOT SKIP)
Stop building. Test the full end-to-end workflow as a team. This hour is the most important. Teams that skip testing and demo broken connected workflows always lose.
Run this exact sequence out loud together:
#
Action
Expected Result
1
Open login page, enter credentials
Redirects to Dashboard
2
Dashboard loads — check all 4 KPI cards show real numbers
No zeroes, no undefined
3
Go to Vehicle Registry, click Add Vehicle, fill form
New vehicle appears in table
4
Go to Driver Profiles, add new driver with future expiry
Driver appears, no red badge
5
Go to Trip Dispatcher, try to create trip with overweight cargo
System rejects with clear error message
6
Create trip with valid cargo weight
Trip created, vehicle + driver show On Trip
7
Check Dashboard — Active Fleet KPI should have increased by 1
Auto-refreshes within 8 seconds
8
Complete the trip from Trip Dispatcher
Vehicle + driver flip back to Available
9
Go to Maintenance Logs, log a service for a vehicle
Vehicle status flips to In Shop
10
Go back to Trip Dispatcher — check that In Shop vehicle is gone from dropdown
Vehicle not visible in available list
11
Close the maintenance log
Vehicle returns to Available, appears in dropdown again
12
Check Analytics page — charts render with data
No blank charts, no API errors
13
Click CSV Export on Analytics page
File downloads with correct data
Every broken step above = one bug to fix in this hour. Split the bugs: Member A fixes API issues, B fixes UI issues, C fixes trip flow, D fixes maintenance flow.
⏱ Hour 5 (4:00 – 5:00) — Polish + Demo Prep
First 20 minutes: Polish. Last 10 minutes: Freeze code. Final 30 minutes: Demo rehearsal.
Member A — Polish
Confirm all API routes return proper error messages with HTTP status codes (400, 401, 404, 500)
Write README.md with setup instructions: git clone, npm install, createdb, migration command, npm run dev
Verify seed data looks realistic (not 'Test Vehicle 1', use proper names like 'Toyota Van-05')
Member B — Polish
Add toast notifications on every form action — 'Vehicle added successfully', 'Trip dispatched', 'Error: license expired'
Add loading spinners on all data fetches (React Query isLoading state)
Add empty state messages on all tables ('No vehicles registered yet. Click + to add one.')
Add global license expiry banner — red bar at the top of every page if GET /api/drivers/expiring-soon returns results
Member C — Polish
Add Fleet Health Score card to dashboard — formula: (availableVehicles / totalVehicles * 100) displayed as percentage
Disable trip submission button and show inline error when cargo weight exceeds limit
Ensure all status pills across every page use consistent colors
Member D — Polish
Final consistency pass on Driver and Maintenance pages — spacing, typography, button styles
Verify the expired license driver (from seed data) shows a red badge and cannot be selected in Trip Dispatcher
Make sure all form fields have proper placeholder text and labels
At 4:50 — STOP CODING. Merge everything into dev, then dev into main, tag release v1.0.
7. Demo Strategy
Your demo has 5 minutes. Judges see 10+ projects in a row. You need a clear opening line, a logical flow, and at least one moment that makes them say 'oh, that's clever.' Plan this as carefully as you plan the code.
7.1 Recommended Demo Flow
Time
Page / Action
What You Say
Who Presents
0:00
Login page
FleetFlow replaces paper logbooks with a live digital command center.
Member B
0:30
Dashboard
This is the at-a-glance view. These 4 KPIs update automatically every 8 seconds — no refresh needed.
Member B
1:00
Vehicle Registry
We track every asset here. Watch what happens when I add a maintenance log...
Member C
1:30
Maintenance → Trip Dispatcher
That vehicle is now In Shop and has disappeared from the dispatcher's available list. One action, automatic consequence.
Member D / C
2:30
Trip Dispatcher — overweight test
If a dispatcher tries to assign 600kg to a 500kg vehicle, the system blocks it before it's even submitted.
Member C
3:00
Driver Profiles — expired license
This driver's license expired. The system shows a system-wide alert and blocks them from being assigned to any trip.
Member D
3:45
Analytics
All of this data rolls up into the analytics page. One click to export the monthly financial summary as a CSV.
Member B
4:30
Wrap up
FleetFlow is built on PostgreSQL, Express, and React. Every status change in the system triggers real database updates.

7.2 Your Three 'Wow Moments'
These are the moments in your demo where a judge looks up from their laptop. Plan to pause briefly after each one.
Wow Moment 1 — The Atomic Status Flip
Open two browser tabs side by side. Tab 1: Maintenance Logs. Tab 2: Trip Dispatcher. Submit a maintenance log on Tab 1. Within 8 seconds, switch to Tab 2 — the vehicle is gone from the dropdown. No page refresh. No manual action. This demonstrates your system actually has real connected state.
Wow Moment 2 — Cargo Validation Inline
On the Trip Dispatcher, type a cargo weight that exceeds the selected vehicle's capacity. Before the judge even reads what you typed, a yellow warning appears and the submit button grays out. Say: 'The system prevents overloading at the point of entry, not after the truck has already left.' Simple validation, huge operational implication.
Wow Moment 3 — System-Wide License Banner
Navigate to any page — Dashboard, Vehicle Registry, anywhere. A red banner is visible at the top because one of the drivers in the system has an expired license. Say: 'A fleet manager can't miss this. It follows them across every page until the license is renewed.' This shows you thought about real operational safety, not just data entry.
7.3 Rehearsal Checklist
Run through the demo flow twice as a team before presenting
Confirm the database has seed data loaded — never demo on empty tables
Confirm the app runs cleanly from a fresh npm run dev with no console errors
Each member knows exactly which page they present and what they click
Agree on the opening line — say it in unison if needed so it sounds rehearsed
Have a fallback: if any page breaks during demo, know which page to jump to next
8. What Makes FleetFlow Stand Out
Feature
What It Does
Why Judges Notice It
Auto-refresh Dashboard
React Query refetchInterval: 8000 — KPIs update every 8 seconds
Feels like a live system, not a static mockup
Atomic Maintenance Flip
One DB transaction: log created + vehicle status changed simultaneously
Demonstrates understanding of data integrity, not just CRUD
Inline Cargo Validation
Warning appears as user types. Submit disabled if over limit.
Prevents operational errors at the source
License Expiry Banner
Red global banner on every page for expiring drivers
Shows proactive safety thinking, not reactive
Fleet Health Score
Single KPI: (available/total)*100 shown as percentage
Managers want one number, not 5 tables to interpret
Seeded Realistic Demo Data
5 vehicles, 5 drivers, 8 trips, 3 maintenance logs pre-loaded
System looks production-ready from second one of demo
Individual Git Commits
Every member has 6+ commits across the 5 hours
Directly meets judging criteria on version control
The teams that win hackathons almost always win on polish and workflow, not on the number of features. A clean demo of 7 working features beats a stuttering demo of 12 half-broken ones every time.

Final reminder: At the 4:50 mark, stop all coding. Tag the release. Rehearse the demo twice. A broken demo of a half-finished feature is always worse than not showing that feature at all.
