FleetFlow: Modular Fleet & Logistics Management System
Objective: To replace inefficient, manual logbooks with a centralized, rule-based digital hub that optimizes
the lifecycle of a delivery fleet, monitors driver safety, and tracks financial performance.
1. Target Users
Fleet Managers: Oversee vehicle health, asset lifecycle, and scheduling.
Dispatchers: Create trips, assign drivers, and validate cargo loads.
Safety Officers: Monitor driver compliance, license expirations, and safety scores.
Financial Analysts: Audit fuel spend, maintenance ROI, and operational costs.
2. Core System Pages
Page 1: Login & Authentication
Purpose: Secure access for different user roles (Manager vs. Dispatcher).
Features: Email/Password fields, "Forgot Password," and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
Page 2: Command Center (Main Dashboard)
Purpose: High-level "at-a-glance" fleet oversight.
KPIs:
• Active Fleet: Count of vehicles currently "On Trip."
• Maintenance Alerts: Number of vehicles marked "In Shop."
• Utilization Rate: % of fleet assigned vs. idle.
• Pending Cargo: Shipments waiting for assignment.
Filters: By Vehicle Type (Truck, Van, Bike), Status, or Region.
Page 3: Vehicle Registry (Asset Management)
Purpose: CRUD operations for physical assets.
Data Points: Name/Model, License Plate (Unique ID), Max Load Capacity (kg/tons), and Odometer.
Logic: Manual toggle for "Out of Service" (Retired).
Page 4: Trip Dispatcher & Management
Purpose: Workflow for moving goods from Point A to Point B.
Features: * Creation Form: Select Available Vehicle + Available Driver.
• Validation Rule: Prevent trip creation if CargoWeight > MaxCapacity
• Lifecycle: Draft → Dispatched → Completed → Cancelled.

Page 5: Maintenance & Service Logs
Purpose: Preventative and reactive health tracking.
Logic Link: Adding a vehicle to a "Service Log" automatically switches its status to "In Shop",
removing it from the Dispatcher's selection pool.
Page 6: Completed Trip, Expense & Fuel Logging
Purpose: Financial tracking per asset.
Features: Record Liters, Cost, and Date.
Calculation: Automated "Total Operational Cost" (Fuel + Maintenance) per Vehicle ID.
Page 7: Driver Performance & Safety Profiles
Purpose: Human resource and compliance management.
Features: * Compliance: License expiry tracking (Blocks assignment if expired).
• Performance: Trip completion rates and "Safety Scores."
• Status: Toggle between On Duty, Off Duty, or Suspended.
Page 8: Operational Analytics & Financial Reports
Purpose: Data-driven decision making.
Metrics: * Fuel Efficiency: km / L.
• Vehicle ROI: \frac{Revenue - (Maintenance + Fuel)}{Acquisition Cost}.
• Exports: One-click CSV/PDF for monthly payroll and health audits.
3. Logic & Workflow Summary
1. Vehicle Intake: Add "Van-05" (500kg capacity) ->Status: Available.
2. Compliance: Add Driver "Alex." System verifies license validity for "Van" category.
3. Dispatching: Assign "Alex" to "Van-05" for 450kg load.
• Check: 450 < 500 (Pass).
• Status Update: Vehicle & Driver -> On Trip.
4. Completion: Driver marks trip "Done," enters final Odometer.
• Status Update: Vehicle & Driver -> Available.
5. Maintenance: Manager logs "Oil Change."
• Auto-Logic: Status -> In Shop. Vehicle hidden from Dispatcher.
6. Analytics: System updates "Cost-per-km" based on fuel logs from the last trip.
4. Technical Requirements
Frontend: Modular UI with scannable data tables and status pills.
Backend: Real-time state management for vehicle/driver availability.
Database: Relational structure to link Expenses/Trips to a specific Vehicle ID
